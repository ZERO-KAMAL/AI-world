                    and its advancements are growing at an exponential rate. The demand for AI is at its peak and if you
                    wish to learn about Artificial Intelligence, you’ve landed at the right place. This blog on
                    Artificial Intelligence With Python will help you understand all the concepts of AI with practical
                    implementations in Python.
                    Why Is Python Best For AI?
                    A lot of people have asked me, ‘Which programming language is best for AI?’ or “Why Python for AI?”
                    Despite being a general purpose language, Python has made its way into the most complex technologies
                    such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and so on.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics,
                    computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and
                    human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of
                    natural language data.

                    Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language
                    understanding, and natural-language generation.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI)
                    that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being
                    explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can
                    access data and use it learn for themselves.
                    The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or
                    instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on
                    the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without
                    human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
